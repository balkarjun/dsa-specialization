# Coursera: Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
My solutions to programming assignments from the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms), implemented in Python 3. These solutions are for **reference only**. Please submit your own implementations to pass the assignments.

The specialization contains 6 courses:
- [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/jarbun/dsa-specialization/tree/master/1-algorithmic-toolbox)
- [Data Structures](https://github.com/jarbun/dsa-specialization/tree/master/2-data-structures)
- [Algorithms on Graphs](https://github.com/jarbun/dsa-specialization/tree/master/3-algorithms-on-graphs)
- [Algorithms on Strings](https://github.com/balkarjun/dsa-specialization/tree/master/4-algorithms-on-strings)
- Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
- Genome Assembly Programming Challenge
